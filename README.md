# 📊 Analyzing Data with Pandas & SQL

This repository has my work from the course **Analyzing Data with Pandas & SQL**.

In this course, we use **Pandas**, a Python library to work with data, and **SQL**, a language to use databases.

## 🚀 About the Course

In this course, you will learn:

- What is **Pandas** and how to use it.
- How to create and work with **DataFrames** and **Series** (tables and columns).
- How to select and filter data using `.loc` and `.iloc`.
- How to use simple and multi-level indexes.
- How to use `groupby`, `merge`, `concat`, and `join`.
- How to work with missing data.
- How to create a **SQL** database and use it with Pandas.
- How to use SQL commands: `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
- How to connect Pandas and SQL to work together.
- How to make **real projects** with data analysis and visualization.

## 👩‍💻 This Course is Good For:

- IT workers who want to learn data analysis.
- People who want to be data analysts or data scientists.
- Business people who use data to make decisions.
- Developers who add data analysis to their apps.
- Researchers using data for school or science projects.
